# 🗳️ Voter Turnout & Demographic Trends

This project explores how voter turnout in U.S. elections varies across different demographic groups. Using U.S. Census data from the 2016 and 2018 elections, we analyzed turnout patterns by age, race, and education.

## 📊 Key Findings
- Voter turnout was significantly lower among younger adults (ages 18–24)
- Adults 65+ showed consistently high turnout in both elections
- Educational attainment strongly correlated with higher turnout
